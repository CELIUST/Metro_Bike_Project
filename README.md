## Introduction
This project is about constructing a data pipeline and establishing data architecture. This project will display data sourcing to visualization, integrating key components of data collection, storage, transformation, and presentation. For this project, both tech skills for handling data and for organizing it well (data architecture) and making it look good (data visualization) are needed. My main goal is to create an efficient data pipeline so to showcase this I've chosen to explore and work with Metro Bike Share Data for this project.
